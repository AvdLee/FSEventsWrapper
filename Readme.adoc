= FSEventsWrapper

A wrapper around FSEvents raw C APIs.

== How to Use?

== State of the Project
In this state, the project does not work except w/ direct linking. Mixing Swift
and ObjC in a framework is not that easy and I hit a lot of corner cases.

Currently everything compiles, but the xcframeworks that get generated (either
static or dynamic) are not usable.

I’ll migrate some new stuff to Swift, and things should get better.
